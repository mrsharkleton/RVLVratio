# RVLVratio
Playing around getting RV:LV ratio for PE quantification

[My ChatGPT discussions regarding shape/thickness analysis](https://chatgpt.com/c/6943d417-8c60-832a-86fa-0aab4c9f7185)
1. PA/Ao diameter ratio using Ali's methods
2. LV and RV thickness analysis -> mapped to AHA 16/17 segment cardiac model, with HU and thickness. Look for underperfused and thin areas
3. Statistical shape atlas for LV and RV ungated CT? What about LA and RA?
4. Statistical shape atlas for PA and PV
5. PA <5mm:>5mm thickness analysis to look for vessel increase/decrease in small vessels.
